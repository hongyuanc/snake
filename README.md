# snake
This quick and simple game of snake uses Tkinter and some conditional statements to run. I made this mainly to experiment and see what it is like making a game, and I plan to have a go with pygame next project. Obviously, I had help from Youtube and see others create this game, but I definitely learnt a lot while coding this game.
